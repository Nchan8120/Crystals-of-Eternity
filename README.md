To run the Demo go to the folder and run the file Build->Crystals of Eternity.exe

This is a 2d tower defense game. There are 4 types of turrets, and 2 gamemodes (waves and timer). We have added a score and health to the UI, and enemies now have sprites. There are 3 new powerups as well. We have added achievements and new menus as well.

Settings is unfinished, and would contain options like graphics and resolution.

This demo contains some code it taken from the 2d tower defense tutorial here: https://www.patreon.com/muddywolf
